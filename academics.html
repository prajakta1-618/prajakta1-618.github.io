                 for my coursework or for student clubs at IISER Mohali. I tend to put a lot efforts in unconventional grading components for the coursework related scientific writing, because I strongly believe that such 
                 components provide the closest exposure to research that courses can provide.<br><br>

                    Date: March, 2023 <br>
                    These are slides of the talk I delivered for The Astronomy Club, IISER Mohali, based on my work in the summer project of 2022. If you require a quick recap of strong gravitational lensing, then this 
                    is a good place to look at!<br><br>

                    Topic: Sexual Selection and the Evolution of the Morphology of Birds of Paradise<br>
                    Date: April, 2023 <br>
                    For this term-paper, we were to choose a topic related to evolutionary biology, study the topic by referring to journal articles/books/other resources in literature, and prepare a maximum 2000-words
                     long report. Being very fascinated by the extravagent physical features of the Birds of Paradise family, I chose the above topic. I recommend to take a quick glance at the term-paper, and if 
                     you feel even slightly intrigued by the photos of these birds, then do read the term-paper. I promise, it's super-interesting! <br><br>

                    For this term-paper, we were to review a journal article, published in a journal with impact factor > 8, related to the course content (QCQI) in a maximum of 400 words. <br><br>

                    This component of course requied us to submit graphic/multimedia illustration of any concept relevant to the course, and a brief description of the submission. The presentation attached above contains
                    graphical illustrations and doodles made by me to explain key concepts related to the methods that people use to study abundance of dark matter. <br><br>

                    Topic: Collection and Analysis of the Avian Data <br>
                    Date: November, 2022 <br>
                    For this lab project, I collected bird abundance data from my neighbourhood for three months, and analysed it for ecological patterns. As a personal interest, I also cleaned and similarly analysed 
                    the data submitted by ~170 students in the course. This data comes from different parts of India (and one student contributing from Oman) and reveals some interesting patterns in avian diversity 
                    across India. <br><br>

                    Date: November, 2020 <br>
                    This course happened during Covid19 pandemic, in online-only mode. The instructor assigned two hands-on projects related to optics to each students to be designed and developed at home. The above document is the report 
                    submitted based on two projects that I made. <br><br>

                    Topic: Bipolar Stepper Motors and x-y Translation Platform Development with 3D Printer for Glass Marking/Cutting with Laser or Plasma. <br>
                    Date: May, 2022 <br>
                    For this project, we attempted to design and develop a small device consisting of a platform that can perform automated translation in x-y plane controlled by an arduino connected to two stepper motors. We prepared a 
                    detailed layout of the platform, with designated spaces to attach the motors in a 3-D designing software Autocad and UltiMaker Cura and got it 3-D printed. We also prepared the program to have the arduino control 
                    the motor motion in calibrated manner. The project assembly, unfortunately, was left incomplete due to lack of time at the end of the semester. <br><br>
