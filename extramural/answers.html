            <li>Subaru, the automobile manufacturing company. </li>

            <br>Subaru is the Japanese name for the Pleiades star cluster M45, or the "Seven Sisters" (one of whom tradition says is invisible – hence only six stars in the Subaru logo), 
            which in turn inspires the logo and alludes to the companies that merged to create Fuji Heavy Industries. <br><br>

                <br><br>The stereo image is the 2015 release of the New Horizons Pluto mission, showing Pluto. Brian May, more famously known for his work with the band Queen, 
                is also an astrophysicist and a science team collaborator with the New Horizons mission. He released the single, New Horizons, in paying tribute to the most 
                distant exploration of a Solar System object by a spacecraft, flyby targeted at Ultima Thule in the Kuiper Belt.                
                <br><br>More trivia: May is also a co-founder of the awareness campaign Asteroid Day and the ‘Asteroid 52665 Brianmay’ is named after him.
