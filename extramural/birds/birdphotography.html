                I'm into birds and I'm also into photography. Which makes a great combination because this way I get to use my camera and my photography skills to freeze atleast some of my birding memories! The following 
                is a compilation of selected bird photos captured using either my Nikon D5200, 35mm-108mm lens or Canon PowerShot SX60 HS, a 60x optical zoom point-and-shoot camera, lent to me by a good friend, Dhwani.
