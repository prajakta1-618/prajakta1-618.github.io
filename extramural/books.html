            <li>In some strange way, any new fact or insight that I may have found has not seemed to me as a "discovery' of mine, but rather as something that had always been there and that I had chanced to pick up.</li>
            <br><li>And, it is often the case that the most "important" discovery of a scientist is his first. In contrast, the deepest creation of an artist is equally often his last. I continue to be puzzled by this dichotomy.</a></li>
            <br><li>The basic concepts gained their validity in proporation to the extent of the domain of natural phenomena which can be explained in terms of them.[...] Scientific values consist in the continual and increasing recognition of the uniformity of nature.[...] In other words, a scientist seeks continually to extend the domain of validity of certain basic concepts.  </li>
