                <h4>
                This is my newfound interest, that I picked up from Sangeetha, a Bangalore-based crochet artist (you can find her work <a href="https://www.instagram.com/_sunandmooncreations_/">here</a>!), and a fellow 
                Physics student. We met at a Physics summer school in 2023 and I, having always wanted to learn crocheting, asked her to teach me. This began my journey in the fascinating world of yarns and hooks and I 
                quickly found myself deeply into it. The academics resumed soon after the summer and now I find myself crocheting on the evenings when work-related things don't work out. It calms me down and 
                gives a sense of satisfaction of creating something new. I'm still a beginner, and also lack a patience of sitting through long projects, so I've so far only worked on small projects that took me a 
                couple of hours to complete. How it usually works is my friends send me suggestions of things they want me to crochet for them, I go through them, and work on things that I find intriguing and doable. 
                Following are amateur-ish photos of such things.
