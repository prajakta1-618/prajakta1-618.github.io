            Hey! I'm sorry that you're not feeling much great. It's been a rough year. I hope everyone around you is safe. 
            Take care of you and your family. Here are few things you can maybe do to make yourself feel a bit better!
        </div>
        <ul class="list">
            <li>Listen to songs(Need a suggestion? <a href="https://youtu.be/_-EB1fopNNA">Christmas Time Again</a>)</li>
            <li>Read cozy <a href="comic.html">comics.</a></li>
            <li>Learn something you always wanted to learn but couldn't find time for. It can be a new language 
                (speaking or programming), some new form of art, a new sport, anything that'll uplift your mood. 
                I learnt basics of HTML, CSS and it feels very awesome when you learn something new, 
                however small it maybe! </li>
            <li>Don't want to do any of this? Doodle! Make repetative patterns, designs, shapes, basically anything 
                your hand draws. It's a great exercise to soothen and calm your mind without needing any skills.</li>
            <li>Watch movies. Choose non-sad movies for starting. Or simply start watching/rewatching F.R.I.E.N.D.S. or B99. 
                From the personal experience, this is a very promising way of making yourself happy and motivated.</li>
            <li>If you're away from your school/university campus due to the pandemic, go through old pictures of campus 
                and your friends!(This might be counter-effective though. Avoid this if you were feeling sad because 
                of nostalgia in the first place :/)</li>
            <li>Last but the most useful, talk to a close friend. Go visit him/her if possible. 
                Feel free to ping me if you don't know whom to talk to :)</li>

        </ul>
        <div class="gift">
            <p>
                For those who still don't feel much good,
                <br> you tried everything, but none of it works? Well, scroll down a bit, have a little gift for you...
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="cookie"><img src="images/cookie.png" class="cookieim"></div>

                <br> You feel good nowww? *4 y-o excited look.*
                <br><br> I know it was silly. You can't really eat that cookie :(  *Starts walking away sadly*<br><br> 
                <br> Oh wait, are you smiling? ... Damn, That is the prettiest smile I've seen in a while!
                <br> Damn, did I just accidentally make you smile? Awwwww, it's even brighter now, isn't it? 
                <br><br> Congratulations! Now you're tempararily happy!!
