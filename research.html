              <div class="home-subtitle">Identifying Gravitational Lenses in Rubin LSST Data</div>
              <div class="home-content">
                I'm doing my master's thesis currently with Prof Dr. Surhud More and Dr. Anupreeta More, at the Inter-University Centre for Astronomy and Astrophysics (IUCAA), Pune. In this work, I'm studying gravitational strong lensing 
                of Type Ia supernovae (SNIa) and developing computational tools to detect such systems in the upcoming LSST survey by the Vera Rubin Observatory. Gravitational lensing is the phenomenon of bending of the light in the 
                presence of a high gravitational potential. Multiply imaged strongly lensed SNIa are critical cosmological probes, as the study of their time delays can be used to obtain better constraints on the expansion rate of the 
                universe i.e., the value of the Hubble constant. <br><br>

                Vera Rubin observatory, currently under construction in Chile, will conduct the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). The LSST survey is aimed to conduct a deep survey of the sky for ten years. Over this duration, it 
                will image about 20,000 deg<sup>2</sup> of sky in the optical wavelength every week. The goal of my thesis work is to construct a pipeline to identify the strongly lensed SNIa from the LSST data, to analyze the pipeline for its 
                efficiency, and to explore the use of these lens systems to constrain the Hubble constant. I am also conducting color-magnitude analysis on the set of simulated multiply-imaged SNIa systems to look for a pattern that can 
                act as an early-detection marker for multiple-imaged SNIa systems in future searches.

              <div class="home-subtitle">Study of Disk Winds in the X-ray Binary Systems</div>
              <div class="home-content">
                An X-ray binary system consists of an accreting compact object, like a black hole or a neutron star, and a stellar companion. It is characterized by extreme gravity, strong magnetic field, and strong particle and radiation 
                densities. A significant mass transfer happens between the two components, and as the transferred matter falls onto the compact object, potential energy is released, which powers the generation of X-ray radiation. <br><br>

                This project consists of spectral analysis and high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy of X-ray binary systems to study the disk wind launching mechanism. Some high inclination X-ray binary systems have been reported in the literature to 
                exhibit blue-shifted, highly ionized absorption lines, especially H- or He-like iron-K lines, on the X-ray continuum spectra. These features are understood to originate from disk winds, whose launching mechanism is still in debate. We 
                analyse Chandra and NICER data for one such system and aim to model these absorption features using high-resolution spectroscopy packages, XSTAR and CLOUDY.

              <div class="home-subtitle">Study of the Tidal Disruption Events</div>
              <div class="home-content">
                For my INSPIRE project work in the summer of 2021, I worked with Dr Aru Beri on studying an astrophysical phenomenon called the tidal disruption events (TDEs). It is a phenomenon that occurs when 
                the orbit of a star gets too close to some compact object, like a black hole, and the star gets disrupted by the tidal forces of the compact object, experiencing spaghettification. I thoroughly studied a few review papers 
                from the literature to develop an understanding of the known properties of TDEs. We then moved on to exploring some of the reported candidates of the TDEs, specifically focussing on the candidates that were reported to 
                accrete in X-ray. I analysed a specific TDE candidate system, WINGS J1348, with extensive archival observations available for Swift-XRT, NICER, NuSTAR, and Chandra. I performed spectral analysis on the Swift-XRT archival 
                datasets of this system in XSPEC, an X-ray spectral fitting package in HEASOFT. I modeled the X-ray emission using a simple model, a combination of the power-law model, the blackbody model, and the galactic extinction 
                model, available in XSPEC. Through this project, I learnt to perform the spectral analysis of accretion emission and about the different emission models available in XSPEC. This was also my first astronomy-related project 
                and first experience working with the data of astrophysical sources. <br><br>

                In addition, this work also exposed me to a broader field of time-domain astronomy, which studies transient astrophysical objects, sources for which the duration of variability may be from milliseconds to days, to a few 
                months. These include violent deep-sky objects like supernovae, gamma-ray bursts, and tidal disruption events. I remember being fascinated by the idea that I could study the variabilities in sources of astronomical 
                scales in my lifetime, and that fascination hasn't faded since! <br><br>
